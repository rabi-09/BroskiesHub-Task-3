# 🚀 BroskiesHub Java Internship - Task 3

This is **Task 3** of the BroskiesHub Java Internship Program.

## 📝 Task Description

A simple Java console application that demonstrates the **usage of Java Collections** and **custom Comparators**. The program manages a list of employees and shows how to sort them using different criteria such as **name** and **salary**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To understand and implement:
- Java **Collections Framework** (`ArrayList`)
- **Custom Comparators** using `Comparator` interface
- Sorting objects with `Collections.sort()`
- Object-Oriented Programming concepts like encapsulation and class structure

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered:

- Object-Oriented Programming
- Java Collections (ArrayList)
- Custom Sorting using Comparator
- Control structures (for-each loop)
- Encapsulation and Data Hiding

## 💻 Sample Output

```plaintext
Unordered Employee List:
Employee Name: Rabi, Age: 20, Salary: 10000
Employee Name: Pratik, Age: 21, Salary: 20000
Employee Name: Smruti, Age: 19, Salary: 5000
Employee Name: Satya, Age: 22, Salary: 50000


Desc Sorted Employee List by Salary:
Employee Name: Satya, Age: 22, Salary: 50000
Employee Name: Pratik, Age: 21, Salary: 20000
Employee Name: Rabi, Age: 20, Salary: 10000
Employee Name: Smruti, Age: 19, Salary: 5000


Asc Sorted Employee List by Name:
Employee Name: Pratik, Age: 21, Salary: 20000
Employee Name: Rabi, Age: 20, Salary: 10000
Employee Name: Satya, Age: 22, Salary: 50000
Employee Name: Smruti, Age: 19, Salary: 5000
```
